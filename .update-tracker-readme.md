# 📊 Time Tracker Auto-Update System

This system automatically updates your time tracker data files from a simple CSV file that can be edited in Excel or any text editor.

node update-tracker-data.js

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Update the CSV file

Edit `content/time-tracker/time-tracker-data.csv` with your data from Notion. The format is tab-separated:

```
Activity Name    This Week Hours    Lifetime Hours
Economics        20.3               634.7
Animal Welfare   0.78               260.95
```

**Easy Method - Copy from Notion:**
1. Copy your time data from Notion (as you showed in your example)
2. Open `content/time-tracker/time-tracker-data.csv` in a text editor
3. Paste the data directly (it's already in the right format!)
4. Save the file

**Alternative - Use Excel:**
1. Open `content/time-tracker/time-tracker-data.csv` in Excel
2. Edit the values in the columns:
   - Column A: Activity Name
   - Column B: This Week Hours
   - Column C: Lifetime Hours
3. Save the file (keep it as CSV format)

### Step 2: Run the Update Script

In your terminal, run:

```bash
node update-tracker-data.js
```

That's it! Both `lifetime-data.js` and `this-week-data.js` will be automatically updated with:
- Current date/time stamps
- Properly formatted numbers
- Sorted activities (by hours, descending)
- Correct color schemes
- Updated max values for the charts

## 📝 What Gets Updated

### lifetime-data.js
- Sorts activities by lifetime hours (highest first)
- Updates the "lastUpdated" date
- Adjusts maxHours for proper chart scaling
- Removes activities with 0 lifetime hours

### this-week-data.js
- Sorts activities by this week's hours (highest first)
- Updates the "weekOf" date range (current week)
- Updates the "lastUpdated" timestamp
- Only includes activities with hours > 0 this week
- Adjusts maxHours for proper chart scaling

## 🎨 Activity Colors

The script automatically assigns colors based on activity names:
- **Economics**: #c99a4d (Bright amber/old gold)
- **Animal Welfare**: #5d8a5d (Vibrant forest green)
- **Leadership**: #8ba68c (Soft sage)
- **Mathematics**: #6e87a8 (Cool slate blue)
- **Philosophy**: #8b5ba8 (Deep purple)
- **Pedagogy**: #8ba68c (Soft sage)
- **Computer Science**: #3a9d9d (Bright teal)
- **Greek**: #b07652 (Warm terracotta)
- **French**: #b07652 (Warm terracotta)

To add new activities, edit the `ACTIVITY_COLORS` object in `update-tracker-data.js`.

## 💡 Tips

- **Backup**: The script overwrites the JS files, so commit your changes to git before running if you're concerned
- **Adding Activities**: Just add new rows to the CSV file
- **Removing Activities**: Delete rows from the CSV file (or set hours to 0)
- **Decimal Places**: The script automatically rounds to 2 decimal places and removes unnecessary zeros
- **Automation**: You can create a simple script or alias to make this even faster

## 🔄 Workflow Example

1. At the end of each week, copy your Notion data
2. Paste it into `content/time-tracker/time-tracker-data.csv`
3. Run `node update-tracker-data.js`
4. Refresh your dashboard - done!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"time-tracker-data.csv not found"**
- Make sure you're running the script from the project root directory
- The CSV file should be at `content/time-tracker/time-tracker-data.csv`

**"No valid data found"**
- Check that your CSV has tab-separated values
- Make sure the data follows the format: `Activity    ThisWeek    Lifetime`

**Colors not showing up**
- Add the activity name to the `ACTIVITY_COLORS` object in the script
