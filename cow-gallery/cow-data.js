        story: "3034 was the calf that ignited my passion for animal welfare research. She was accidentally born outside of the maternity pen and was nearly swept away by the manure scraper; by chance, I was there to save her. However, what stayed with me was the sound of 7 cows calling for help while carefully maneuvering their 1500 lbs bodies to not trample her. That moment made me realize how little we truly understand cows, and how much we owe them the effort to try."

        image: "cow-gallery/images/Rocky.jpg",
        story: "Rocky was a 4H steer, particularly one showed by the son of the owner of K&M Farms. He was as gentle as can be; the owner mentioned that he is very unaware of his humongous size, and often make way for people that are walking by."
